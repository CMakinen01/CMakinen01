## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹


### I am Camden Makinen, and I am a Senior Computer Science student at EKU.



- Iâ€™m currently working on converting my older school projects to run on their own local databases, as well as new projects that showcase my skills as a full-stack developer.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby, GatsbyJS, EmberJS, and PostgreSQL.
- I am proficient with using Java, C++, C#, Oracle SQL, and JavaScript.

  
- Please look forward to seeing more of my work soon!
